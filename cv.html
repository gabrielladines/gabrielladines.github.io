    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Care Assistant | <em>Bluebird Care Camden & Hampstead</em></li>

    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">February 2022 - July 2022</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attention to detail: Maintaining detailed records, revising individual descriptions of each unique customer including eating, drinking, sleeping, washing and medicine schedules as well as important and specific details of what potential risks/harm to look out for.</li>
            <li>Communication skills: It was crucial that my communication skills were up to scratch. If anything occurred, from the smallest thing I was confused about, to a much bigger problems, I had to communicate fast and effectively to my managers to ask questions, get clarification and get the right thing done to minimise harm and risk.</li>
            <li>Ability to work under pressure: Due to the nature of the job, there was not a day of work where I was not required to work under pressure. Every customer, despite their differences in requirements, they all had something in common: they were all vulnerable. The different range of responsibilities I had developed my exposure to real-life problems and being hands-on with them.</li>
            <li>Teamwork: I often had to work in teams with new workers I had never met, and sometimes family members I had never met, with different requirements, needs and expectations. Responsibilities were shared, I had to identify what my teammate needed additional help with and be able to communicate and keep ‘up to speed’ with what medications to give/not to give, what other care has been fulfilled and what is yet to be completed. </li>
