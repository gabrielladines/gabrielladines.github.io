        <p>
            I took a 4 week course to learn Python. This course includes a 2 hour webinar once a week with a required 2 hours per week to do the tasks provided, a total of at least 20+ hours to complete the course.
        </p>
        <h2>Session 1</h2>
        <h3><i>Conditional flow; Intro to Python</i></h3>
        <h4>The webinar</h4>
        <p>During this session I mainly recieved an introduction, some basic aspects of python (what a string, boolean, intiger and float is), how to make variable, how to set conditions, and mainly about how to make <i>if statements</i> as well as nested <i>if statements.</i> By the end of the webinar, we were given our first set of tasks to do, which we had a week to complete and submit. This consisted of 9 tasks (although the 8th and 9th tasks were optional).</p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a file called <i>control_flow_atm.py</i>.</li>
            <li>Create a variable called <i>balance</i> with an int value representing the money in the user's account.</li>
            <li>Create a variable called <i>pin</i> with an int value (for example 1234).</li>
            <li>Prompt the user to enter their pin.</li>
            <li>If the pin value match, display <i>balance.</i></li>
            <li>If they don't match, print out a message notifying the user.</li>
            <li>If the pin matches, give the prompt to the user if they'd like to withdraw or deposit some money.</li>
            <li>Once they made their choice, prompt them to enter an amount.</li>
            <li>Subtract or add the value to their account, then display the updated balance.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>What I did</h4>

        <h4>What I found challenging</h4>
        <p>I had done <i>if statements</i> before, and I was good at them, but my lack of practise had made me forget. This created a big problem for me, as I was not sure what mistake I was making. I even when I tried to experiment and take different approaches, once running my tests, I had found out that I was still not achieving the desired results. The repetitiveness of not getting the desired results over again was frustrating.</p>
        <h4>What I enjoyed</h4>
        <p>Making a break-through after a lot of trial an error. The motivation I got from making a break-through, and being able to complete all of the tasks was amazing. Fighting to carry on trying no matter how frustrating it got, and getting the desired results was amazing.</p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>Asking for help and searching for knowledge is really important. The biggest challenge I had during this task for due to one small mistake. A lot of the frustration I experienced could have been avoided if I had asked for help a lot earlier. I also learned not to under-estimate a task at hand. I originally thought it would take my 10 minutes to complete all the tasks, but it actually took me much longer than the required 2 hours. </p>
        <h2>Session 2</h2>
        <h3><i>Lists, dictionaries, and loops</i></h3>
        <h4>The webinar</h4>
        <p>This session showed me a variety of functions. Lists[] and dictionaries{} were shown separately and together, with a dictionary inside a list. We were shown how to access the tupples made for us. For and while loops were demonstrated, showcasing the common problems that occur when using these loops. I was taught how to intergrate 'if' statements into a loop.</p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>In a for loop, print out each river's name.</li>
                <li>In another for loop, add up and print out the total length of all the rivers.</li>
                <li>Print out every river's name that begins with the letter "M".</li>
                <li>The length of the rivers are in miles. Print out every river's length in kilometres (1 mile is roughly 1.6km).</li>
            </ol>
        <h4>What I did</h4>
        <img src="./assets/html_task2.png" width="512px">
        <h4>What I found challenging</h4>
        <p>I was running into the mistake during <i>task 2</i> of my code printing a list of the <i>lengths</i> rather that adding the count of the numbers together. I was not sure straight away what I had done wrong, and researching how to do what I wanted the program to do was not simple either.</p>
        <h4>What I enjoyed</h4>
        <p>Learning that you can have a large set of data and be able to solve mathematical problems that might be needed. Being able to collect the sum of a large quantity of numbers or convert it into an average, for example, was great to learn.</p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>Experimenting and running tests is crucial for learning.</p>
        <h2>Session 3</h2>
        <h3><i>Algorithms and 3rd party packages</i></h3>
        <h4>The webinar</h4>
        <p>During the session I was taught what an algorithm is, and how to create one. The teacher explained the importance of writing an algorithm, and I got to do some practise before the main tasks. I was also taught how to import third party packages. I had to convert an excel file into a csv file. I was then shown how to print a variety of data from a large csv file.</p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Print the name of the person who has the highest salary at the company.</li>
            <li>Print the combined years of experience of all employees at the company.</li>
            <li>Some people don't have en email address - collect their details into a new list.</li>
            <li>Which one costs more for the company - Product department salaries or Business department salaries?</li>
            <li>What is the average salary for people over 30 years of age?</li>
            <li>Create a new <i>dict</i> and calculate how many people are working with certain job titles e.g. <i>{"Project Manager": 4, "Machine Learning Engineer": 3, ...}</i></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>What I did</h4>
        <img src="./assets/task3_html.png" width="512px">
        <h4>What I found challenging</h4>
        <p>Up to this point during the course, it seemed as though the challenges were repeating itself. It was mainly trial and error until the tests passed.</p>
        <h4>What I enjoyed</h4>
        <p>Similar to <i>session 2,</i> I enjoyed the variety of being able to access different points of data, especially as there were a range of data types and it was a large amount of data. It was amazing to experience this: being able to write a program to make a, what would usually be a time-consuming task, into an easy and accessable to the data needed at hand, program.</p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>Having patience is important during the process of writing a program you have in mind. Trial and error will almost always occur. It is important to recognise when you are making the same kind of mistake over again to be more efficient whilst programming. Taking iniciative to research when you don't know what to do is key.</p>
        <h2>Session 4</h2>
        <h3><i>Data analysis; Reading and writing to CSV files</i></h3>
        <h4>The webiner</h4>
        <p>General exposure to a large excel file, which was converted into a CSV file. I recieved a tutorial on how to import 'pandas' and 'matplotlab' and how to use these to creat bar and pie charts from the large set of data, as well as how to personalise them and make them more presentable.</p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What is the most expensive Volkswagen car listed?</li>
            <li>Find all the Volkswagen Golf models. What is their average price?</li>
            <li>What is the average mileage for the Volkswagen Polo models registered in 2020?</li>
            <li>A pie chart showing the distribution between fuel types.</li>
            <li>A bar chart showing the average mileage for each model.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>What I found challenging</h4>
        <p>At times, I did not know why the computer made an error, and sometimes it was something as simple as a typo. Small mistakes which can take up time to fix if you don't notice the typo just from glancing at your code.</p>
        <h4>What I enjoyed</h4>
        <p>Making bar and pie charts and applying new softwar skills was fun and interesting. Getting exposure to data analysis was intriguing.</p>
        <h4>What I learned</h4>
        <p>Paying attention to the details of your code as you go along is important to make sure that uf you get any errors, you are able to reduce time by ensuring that it is not a small mistake such as a typo, rather than misuse or incorrect function.</p>
