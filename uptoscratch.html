        <li>If you go to <a href="./couchtocoder.html" class="menu-item" style="padding: 2px;">Couch to Coder</a>, you will be able to see the work I done in order to achieve my certificate. After the course had finished, I decided the best way for me to maintain the skills I had acquired, were to do the tasks again, until it was automatic. This is one of the things I commit to during my spare time.</li>
        <li>I am also practising my analytical data skills by persuing csv projects. You can check them put here: <a href="./csvskills.html" class="menu-item" style="padding: 2px;">CSV Projects</a>.</li>
